# happy-birthday

Automatically sends happy birthday to people in my contacts that meet the following criteria:

1. It is their birthday today
2. They have the flag set happyBirthday=true in their contact info
3. They have a cell phone number (phone number filled out as mobile in Google contacts)

The lambda runs once a day at 9:00 EST.
